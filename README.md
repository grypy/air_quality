### Wearable sensor technology: case study for welders in Kigali Rwanda

This project aims to assess the air quality in welding workshops and garage. This area is of interests as the young population in Africa is estimated to find employment in the informal crafts trade sector. The welders and mechanics form a large part of the informal sector and are consistently exposed to poor air quality. There is little or no data on the air quality in these workshops, therefore, this projects seeks to:
- Assess the air quality in the welding and garage workshops
- Assess the health condition of welders using wearable technology
- Assess the mortality rate due to the poor air quality (In a sense: Life span of welders and mechanics)
- Develop a tool that monitors the health of a welder or mechanic and their workshop to ensure that they are consistently breathing in cleaner air
- Additionally, to develop policies that govern the workshop structures and conversely, the desirable health practices.
